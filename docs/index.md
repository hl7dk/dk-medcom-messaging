# MedCom Messaging 

This page represents the messaging profiles (DK: Meddelelsesprofiler) used in MedComs FHIR standards. The messaging profiles are static and used across MedComs messaging standards, currently including HospitalNotification, CareCommunication and Acknowledgement. The messaging profiles do not alone constitute a standard, but one or more profiles will be used in a standard. Therefore does this page only include the Implementation Guide (IG) and not clinical guidelines, use cases, test protocols.
